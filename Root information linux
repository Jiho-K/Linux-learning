Root information

bin - Essential command binaries
boot - static files (should not be changed typically) that loads up when the computer/device boots
dev - Device specific files
etc - host specific system configuration
		Stores all information on the changes the user made such as keyboard changes
home - user home directory
		you can access your files through /home/(user_name)
		if you have sudo access you may be able to access another user's files??
			(to test in the future)
		However, creating a file inside home does NOT create a new user

The root partition MUST contain /bin, /sbin, /lib, /etc, /dev in order to boot.

/user contains all user programs (/user/bin), libraries (/user/lib), documentation (/user/share/doc), etc.
	This is heavily recommended to be included for boot to work properly.

/var contains variable information such as emails, websites, database, system cache, etc.
	

/tmp contains temporary files (temporarily store images, files, etc. and deleted soon after)
	generally cleaned out at boot time or shutdown
	stored on the RAM
	large files goes into /var/tmp because RAM is small (typically)
